TODO: Note in the application.conf the strange ip address, that is the address for the docker-machine on my local
host I want that to be able to use 0.0.0.0

This ip can be obtained by running 'docker-machine ip discover'

SSL key
/etc/ssl

Note: It appears that using the hostname as 'elasticsearch' works for connectivity from inside a docker container...
	  However this will not work from inside intellij as this hostname is configured in the docker-compose file.
